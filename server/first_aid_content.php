<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="overview"></a> What are snake bites?</h2>
<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_1">
About 7,000 venomous snake
bite cases are reported every year in the United States. A bite from a
venomous snake is rarely deadly , about 6 fatalities are reported every year, but
it should always be treated as a medical emergency. Even a bite from a harmless
snake can be serious, leading to an allergic reaction or an infection. Venomous
snake bites can produce an array of symptoms, including localized pain and
swelling, convulsions, nausea, and even paralysis.<br />
First aid steps you can take after a snake bite occurs include cleaning the wound,
remaining calm, and immobilizing the affected area. However, it\'s essential to
get to a medical facility immediately for emergency treatment. If treated in
time, the outlook for recovery is good.</div>

<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_2">
If you are unfamiliar with the different types of snakes and unable to
distinguish between venomous and non-venomous ones, it can be difficult to know
how to respond in the event of a bite. <b>Always treat a snake bite as if
it’s venomous. </b><br />
While most snakes in the U.S. are not venomous, several types do contain venom.
In the U.S., all of the venomous snakes, except for the coral snake, are pit
vipers. Pit vipers are distinguishable by a noticeable depression between the
eye and nostril. This pit is the heat-sensing area for the snake. While all pit
vipers have a triangular head, not all snakes with a triangular head are
venomous. <br />
If you or someone you are with has been bitten by a snake, you will know
immediately. It’s possible, though, for the bite to happen quickly and for the
snake to disappear. <br />
To identify a snake bite, consider the following general symptoms:<br />
<ul>
<li>two puncture wounds</li>
<li>swelling and redness around
     the wounds</li>
<li>pain at the bite site</li>
<li>difficulty breathing</li>
<li>vomiting and nausea</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>sweating and salivating</li>
<li>numbness in the face and
     limbs</li>
</ul>
Some venomous snakes also cause symptoms specific to their type.</div>

Rattlesnakes are easily identifiable. They have rings at the end of their
tails that shake when they feel threatened. This makes a rattling sound and is
a warning for you to back away. Rattlesnakes are the largest of the venomous
snakes and account for many of the venomous bites in the U.S. each year. These
snakes can be found in nearly any habitat across the country. They like open
areas where they can rest in the sun such as rocks, and logs.<br />

The water moccasin is another type of pit viper. This snake is also known as
a cottonmouth, because the inside of its mouth is lined with a white, cottony
material. The water moccasin’s average size is between 50 to 55 inches. Adults
have dark tan to black skin with faint dark brown or black crossbands. Young
snakes have brown or orange crossbands with a yellow tail. These snakes are
found in the southeastern states, usually in or near water. They don’t scare
easily, and will defend themselves should they feel threatened.<br />

Copperheads are reddish or gold in color with hourglass-shaped bands. This
snake is typically 18 to 36 inches in length. Copperheads are mostly found in
forests, swamps, rocky areas, and rivers in the eastern states (as far as
Texas). They are not aggressive. Most copperhead bites occur if you

aid for snake bites</h2>
<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_7">
Should you be bitten by a snake, it’s essential to get emergency treatment as
quickly as possible. However, there are some tips that you should also keep in
mind:<br />
<ul>
<li>Call 911 immediately.</li>
<li>Note the time of the bite.</li>
<li>Keep calm and still as movement
     can cause the venom to travel more quickly through the body. </li>
<li>Remove constricting clothing
     or jewelry because the area surrounding the bite will likely swell.</li>
<li>Don’t allow the victim to
     walk. Carry or transport them by vehicle.</li>
<li>Do not kill or handle the
     snake. Take a picture if you can but don’t waste time hunting it down.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
First aid myths</h3>
There are also several outdated first aid techniques that are now believed
to be unhelpful or even harmful:<br />
<ul>
<li>Do not use a tourniquet.</li>
<li>Do not cut into the snake
     bite.</li>
<li>Do not use a cold compress on
     the bite.</li>
<li>Do not give the person any
     medications unless directed by a doctor.</li>
<li>Do not raise the area of the
     bite above the victim’s heart.</li>
<li>Do not attempt to suck the
     venom out by mouth.</li>
<li>Do not use a pump suction
     device. These devices were formerly recommended for pumping out 
snake venom, but it\'s now believed that they are more likely to do harm 
than good.</li>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="treatment"></a> Treatment
for snake bites</h2>
<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_8">
The most important thing to do for a snake bite is to get emergency
medical help as soon as possible. A doctor will evaluate the victim to decide
on a specific course of treatment. In some cases, a bite from a venomous snake
is not life-threatening. The severity depends on the location of the bite and
the age and health of the victim. If the bite is not serious, the doctor may
simply clean the wound and give the victim a tetanus vaccine.<br />
If the situation <i>is&nbsp;</i>life threatening, the doctor may administer antivenom. This is a substance created with snake venom to counter the snake
bite symptoms. It’s injected into the victim. The sooner the antivenom
is used, the more effective it will be.</div>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="outlook"></a> Outlook for a snake bite</h2>
<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_9">
The outlook for a person with a snake bite is highly variable. For a
non-venomous snake bite, the outlook is excellent if the wound is cleaned and
treated promptly. For a venomous bite, the outlook is good if the victim
receives emergency care very soon after the bite has occurred. Healthy adults
with shallow bites have a better outlook than children and those with weakened
immune systems who have received deep bites.</div>

<a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="prevention"></a> Prevention of snake
bites</h2>
<div class="content_body" id="TOC_TITLE_10">
Snake bites can be prevented in many cases. It’s best to refrain from
approaching or handling snakes in the wild. Avoid typical places where snakes
like to hide, such as patches of tall grass and piled leaves, and rock and
woodpiles. If you encounter a snake, give it space to retreat and let it take
cover. It’s in the snake’s nature to avoid interaction. <br />
When working outside where snakes may be present, wear tall boots, long
pants, and leather gloves. Avoid working outside during the night and in warmer
weather, which is when snakes are most active.</div>

Someone having a heart attack may experience any or all of the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Uncomfortable pressure, fullness or squeezing pain in the center of the chest</li>
<li>Discomfort or pain spreading beyond the chest to the shoulders, 
neck, jaw, teeth, or one or both arms, or occasionally upper abdomen</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Light headedness, dizziness, fainting</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
</ul>
A heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes, 
but it can also have no symptoms at all. Many people who experience a 
heart attack have warning signs hours, days or weeks in advance.<br />
<h3>
What to do if you or someone else may be having a heart attack</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Call 911 or your local medical emergency number.</b>
 Don\'t ignore or attempt to tough out the symptoms of a heart attack for
 more than five minutes. If you don\'t have access to emergency medical 
services, have a neighbor or a friend drive you to the nearest hospital.
 Drive yourself only as a last resort, and realize that it places you 
and others at risk when you drive under these circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Chew and swallow an aspirin,</b> unless you are 
allergic to aspirin or have been told by your doctor never to take 
aspirin. But seek emergency help first, such as calling 911.</li>
<li><b>Take nitroglycerin,</b> if prescribed. If you think
 you\'re having a heart attack and your doctor has previously prescribed 
nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed. Do not take anyone else\'s 
nitroglycerin, because that could put you in more danger.</li>

Someone having a heart attack may experience any or all of the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Uncomfortable pressure, fullness or squeezing pain in the center of the chest</li>
<li>Discomfort or pain spreading beyond the chest to the shoulders, 
neck, jaw, teeth, or one or both arms, or occasionally upper abdomen</li>
<li>Shortness of breath</li>
<li>Light headedness, dizziness, fainting</li>
<li>Sweating</li>
<li>Nausea</li>
</ul>
A heart attack generally causes chest pain for more than 15 minutes, 
but it can also have no symptoms at all. Many people who experience a 
heart attack have warning signs hours, days or weeks in advance.<br />
<h3>
What to do if you or someone else may be having a heart attack</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Call 911 or your local medical emergency number.</b>
 Don\'t ignore or attempt to tough out the symptoms of a heart attack for
 more than five minutes. If you don\'t have access to emergency medical 
services, have a neighbor or a friend drive you to the nearest hospital.
 Drive yourself only as a last resort, and realize that it places you 
and others at risk when you drive under these circumstances.</li>
<li><b>Chew and swallow an aspirin,</b> unless you are 
allergic to aspirin or have been told by your doctor never to take 
aspirin. But seek emergency help first, such as calling 911.</li>
<li><b>Take nitroglycerin,</b> if prescribed. If you think
 you\'re having a heart attack and your doctor has previously prescribed 
nitroglycerin for you, take it as directed. Do not take anyone else\'s 
nitroglycerin, because that could put you in more danger.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Begin CPR if the person is unconscious.</b> If 
you\'re with a person who might be having a heart attack and he or she is
 unconscious, tell the 911 dispatcher or another emergency medical 
specialist. You may be advised to begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
(CPR). If you haven\'t received CPR training, doctors recommend skipping 
mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing and performing only chest compressions 
(about 100 per minute). The dispatcher can instruct you in the proper 
procedures until help arrives. </li>
<li><b>If an automated external defibrillator (AED) is available</b>
 and the person is unconscious, begin CPR while the device is retrieved 
and set up. Attach the device and follow instructions that will be 
provided by the AED after it has evaluated the person\'s condition.</li>
